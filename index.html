              <h5>EDITING COACHING</h5>
              <p>

                We offer you writing guidance, editing, and proofreading, and we're not done until you are completely satisfied. We coach you personally to discuss your writing and our editing. Here's how the process works:
              </p>

              <li>
                  You send us your document. You tell us your time constraints.
              </li>
              <li>We give you a price quotation.</li>
              <li>Upon receiving your approval and initial payment, we assign you to one of our highly skilled and experienced editors.</li>
              <li>Your document is edited, and all changes are clearly indicated. Your editor will include comments to aid you in your future writing, and your editor will discuss the document and changes with you.</li>
              <li>Final payment is due when you are satisfied with the edited document.</li>

              <p>Here are some of the types of documents with which we can help you. If you have any others, please ask; we can accommodate most editing needs.</p>
                <li>Paper editing for academic journals and conferences</li>
                <li>Book editing</li>
                <li>Proposal editing</li>

              <h5>APPLICATION PACKAGE COACHING FOR TOP US UNIVERSITIES</h5>
              <p>Which university you enter will largely determine your career, your happiness,
                  and your success. No matter what great scores you achieved on your GRE, SAT, and TOEFL,
                  your efforts might all be wasted if you do not submit right application packages
                  to your "best-fit" top universities. What counts most is the application package.
                  People with lower GRE and TOEFL scores can still end up in Ivy League universities because these institutions recruit talented students that show uniqueness. How to reflect your uniqueness in your application to your dream university is truly critical.</p>
                <p>Silicon Valley English Institute is dedicated to your success by providing premium services. We only select top candidates to work with. To find out whether you are qualified to participate, please contact us. Once we decide to work with each other, a personal mentor will be assigned to you, to help you prepare compelling application packages. Your mentor will:</p>
                <li>Work with you to come up with an outstanding "personal statement" that tells your story</li>
                <li>Guide you in building a compelling CV</li>
                <li>Coach you in creating your writing samples</li>
                <li>Propose 10-20 universities, based on your desired programs and goals</li>
                <li>Help you package and submit all the applications</li>
                <li>Coach you and offer practice in interview skills</li>
                <li>Assist you with all your communications, until you get your desired offer</li>
